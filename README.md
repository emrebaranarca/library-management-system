# 📚 Library Management System

A robust and user-friendly library management system built with Java, designed to streamline the operations of libraries and educational institutions. This project demonstrates advanced Object-Oriented Programming principles and modern design patterns including Builder Pattern and Parameter Object Pattern for clean, maintainable, and scalable code architecture.

## 🎯 Project Description

The Library Management System is a comprehensive solution that helps librarians and administrators manage their library resources efficiently. Built with a strong focus on software design principles, it implements the Builder Pattern for complex object creation, Parameter Object Pattern for method parameter encapsulation, and follows SOLID principles throughout the codebase. The system provides a console-based interface for managing books, users, and borrowing operations while maintaining high code quality and extensibility.

### Key Features
- 📖 Book management (add, remove, search, update)
- 👥 User management system
- 🔄 Borrowing and returning functionality
- 📊 Simple and intuitive console interface
- 🏗️ Modular architecture for easy maintenance

### Technologies
- Java 17
- Console-based UI
- Object-Oriented Design Patterns
- Service-oriented Architecture

## 🚀 Installation Guide
